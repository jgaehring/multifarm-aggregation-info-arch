# Multifarm Aggregation & Information Architecture (MAIA) Project
The MAIA Project is a collaborative effort by members of [Skywoman](https://skywoman.community)'s [Design & Tech Incubator](https://github.com/skywoman) to map out and assess the methods, needs and pain-points of food aggregation services, with a focus on distribution models that promote regional food sovereignty.

The project will center around a series of technical interviews with food producers, distributors, retailers and others who either operate their own aggregation service or participate in one. This may take the form of a single- or multi-farm CSA, traditional food coops, an informal network of distributors and retailers, or more centralized food hubs where products from multiple farms are warehoused and sold through one or more distribution channels. The primary outcome will be a collection of interview materials, documents and case studies, made freely available under Creative Commons or a similar license, which will map each interviewee's user journey and the information architecture that underlies their operation.

Nate Chang, a User Experience Designer and Data Strategist, has graciously volunteered to guide the first series of technical interviews, but we're seeking participation from other designers, engineers and anyone else from the Skywoman community with an active interest. 

These sessions will be technical in nature, with an aim towards forming a rigorous model of the aggregation process, but we also hope to share these materials and insights with a broader audience in the form of a public presentation when we conclude the first series of events. This should provide a more digestible and high-level view of what we learn — something of a capstone event for these initial interviews and design sessions — as well as a roadmap for future development, so stay tuned for that!

For more background on where this came from and where it's going, see the [original post](https://www.skywoman.community/post/toward-a-platform-cooperative-for-food-sovereignty) on the motivations and broader goals of this project.
