# Multi-farm Information Architecture
This project will center around a series of technical interviews with people who run aggregation services, either as a multi-farm CSA or a more centralized food hub, where product from multiple farms is pooled and sold through one or more distribution channels. The primary outcome will be a collection of interview materials, documents and case studies, made freely available under Creative Commons or a similar license, which will map each interviewee's user journey and the information architecture that underlies their operation.

The first group of participants that have agreed to be interviewed are Kip Curtis from Ohio State University, who has been developing the [Microfarm Project](https://osumarion.osu.edu/alumni-initiatives/initiatives/microfarm.html) together with Walt Bonham and Jess Hudson of the [Richland Gro-Op](https://richlandgro-op.com/). After that we will interview Tianna Kennedy from [Star Route Farm](http://www.starroutefarmny.com/) in Charlotteville, NY, who also owns and operates [the 607 CSA](https://www.the607csa.com/info) serving dozens of farms and independent food producers in the Hudson Valley.

Nate Chang, a User Experience Designer and Data Strategist, has graciously volunteered to guide the technical interviews, with additional input from other designers and engineers in the Skywoman community, which is where these first interviews will be hosted. I encourage any and all who are interested to attend, but I'll warn that these sessions will indeed be technical in nature, with an aim towards forming a rigorous model of the aggregation process, so it may be a bit of a snoozer if that's not your jam.

If you're not exactly into all the technical minutiae, fear not; we also hope to share these materials and insights with a broader audience in the form of a public presentation, which will provide a more digestible and high-level view of what we learn â€” something of a capstone event for these initial interviews and design sessions. Hopefully we can lay down a roadmap for future development, too, so stay tuned for that!
