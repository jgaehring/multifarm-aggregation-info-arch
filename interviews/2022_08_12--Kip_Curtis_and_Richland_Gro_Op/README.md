## Action Items
- Explore ways to make the auditing process easier and not always require a site visit from Jess to confirm growers are on-track to meet their target volumes in time for orders.
- Possibly schedule a follow-up interview with Jess to discuss the auditing process further.
- Follow-up questions:
  - What margins for error does Jess factor into the target volumes when she makes her crop plans?
  - What mitigating actions is she able to take when farmers are not on course to meet their target volumes?
