## Notes
[from Jamie]

- Richland Gro-Op is ["prescriptive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription), whereas 607 is more ["descriptive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description)
  - also, an interesting article on ["Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics"](https://www.logility.com/blog/descriptive-predictive-and-prescriptive-analytics-explained/), I found while searching
- Where this domain model, which privileges 607 CSA's concerns, interfaces with external entities such as farmers, customers, etc, who may be operating under a compatible or conflicting domain model, what are the potential affordances or frictions that arise from that interaction? 
  - "Actors", in service blueprint, is another way to say "entities"
  - costs/benefits, efficiencies, trade-offs
  - put another way: What are the value exchanges between the different actors?
- Maybe use "4 forces" (push/pull; inertia/anxieties) in framing the questions
